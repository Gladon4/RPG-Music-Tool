# RPG-Music-Tool (ver. 0.4.1 [First Release])

A small music tool for TTRPGs.

This Tool allows you to play music based on the current theme or setting for your TableTop RolePlayingGames.
This Program uses local music files, instead of for example a Spotify Playlist. So you can always use it as long as you have your music with you.

## Install
Download the executable for your system from the Release section.

## How to set up songs and themes:
### 1.

Start the program and open the Path Settings. There you can add the paths to the directories of your music. Separate different paths by line breaks.

## How to Use it:

The Program should display all created themes and how!
 many songs are associated with that theme.
Just click on the theme you currently need and it should start playing a random sequence of songs with the chosen theme.
(This is suited well for touch displays, if you have one)
You can also Stop or Pause the playback, or skip the current song.
You can see how much time is remaining and you can control the volume.
