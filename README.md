# RPG-Music-Tool (ver. 0.3 [Usability Update])

A small music tool for TTRPGs.

This Tool allows you to play music based on the current theme or setting for your TableTop RolePlayingGames.
This Program uses local music files, instead of for example a Spotify Playlist. So you can always use it as long as you have your music with you.

## Python Dependencies (Use pip to install):

pygame

tkinter

ttk

mutagen

configparser

This is python, so just install python3 and libraries and it should work.


## How to set up:
### 1.

Supports Windows and Linux as of now!

Download the repository, either as a zip and unzip it, or with git clone.

### 2.

Start the program and open the Path Settings in the Settings Menu. There you can add the paths to the directories of your music. Separate different paths by line breaks.

### 3.

Then you can open the Song Settings. All mp3 files in your set directories are listed there and you can add themes to them there. Separate multiple themes by semicolon ";". Press the Update Themes Button at the bottom.

### 4. (Optional)

Customize the colours of the Program! The Color Settings Menu allows you to costomize the look of the Program.


## How to Use it:

The Program should display all created themes and how many songs are associated with that theme.
Just click on the theme you currently need and it should start playing a random sequence of songs with the chosen theme.
(This is suited well for touch displays, if you have one)

You can also Stop or Pause the playback, or skip the current song.
You can see how much time is remaining and you can control the volume.
